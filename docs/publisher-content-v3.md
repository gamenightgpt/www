## The Partnership

We introduce your players to GameNightGPT, our board-game rules assistant used across hundreds of games.

In exchange for offering free rules Q&A on your site, we include a small, unobtrusive link in answers where interested players can explore GameNightGPT for other games or advanced features.

No ads. No pop-ups. No disruption to your brand.

You can remove or update your content at any time—no lock-in, no obligation.
