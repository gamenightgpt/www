Hey there, everyone! ðŸŽ² We're super excited to introduce you to GameNightGPT. Your new go-to for sorting out tricky board game rules.

## Why We Built GameNightGPT

You know that moment when you're crushing it, totally in the zone, and then BAM â€“ someone asks a rules question that stops everything cold? Suddenly you're all digging through the rulebook, arguing about what "adjacent" really means, and someone's inevitably pulling up a forum on their phone.

Yeah, we've all been there. Honestly, it's a buzzkill.

So, we made GameNightGPT to save your game nights from those momentum-killing rules rabbit holes.

## How It Works

Pick your game from our library of 200+ titles, then just ask your question like you're talking to a friend:

- Can I actually build next to their city?
- Can I temporarily exceed the hand limit?
- Do these energy tokens have to match the card color?

You'll get a straight answer instantly, pulled from official rules, FAQs, and all those publisher clarifications. We always show you exactly where we got the info, so you know itâ€™s right. ðŸ˜‰
