We're thrilled to announce the launch of GameNightGPT, a revolutionary AI assistant designed to answer all your board game rules questions instantly.

## Why We Built GameNightGPT

Every board gamer knows the frustration: you're deep into an exciting game when suddenly a rules question comes up. The momentum stops. Someone grabs the rulebook. Minutes pass as you flip through pages, debate interpretations, and search forums for clarifications.

We built GameNightGPT to solve this problem once and for all.

## How It Works

Simply ask your rules question in natural language, just like you would ask a friend:

- "Can I build a settlement next to another player's city in Catan?"
- "What happens when I land on Free Parking in Monopoly?"
- "How does monster focus work in Gloomhaven?"

GameNightGPT instantly provides accurate answers based on official rulebooks, FAQs, and publisher clarifications. Every answer includes source citations so you can verify the information.

## Join the Waitlist

We're currently in limited beta, accepting 50 new users every Monday. Join our waitlist to be among the first to experience game nights without rules interruptions.

Stay tuned for more updates, tips, and insights about board gaming!
