            We are <strong>Dallan and Solveig Quass</strong>, and we love games. Dungeon crawlers, Euros, Amerigames. And the more minis the better.

          <p class="text-lg text-body leading-relaxed mt-6">
            What we don't love is <em>"Hold on, let me check the rulebook…"</em> five minutes later… ten minutes later… three web searches later… <em>"Do you think this is right? Maybe?"</em>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-heading mb-4">About Us</h2>
          <p class="text-body leading-relaxed">
            We're semi-retired (you know, the kind of people who can't quit building things). Solveig paints the minis and writes science fiction. Dallan is a software engineer who specialized in search and AI.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Our Mission -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-8 shadow-sm border border-[var(--border-subtle)] mb-8">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-heading mb-4">More Than Just Rules</h2>
          <p class="text-body leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Along the way, we spent two years volunteering in West Africa, remotely, helping BYU-Pathway Worldwide students receive training for better employment. We discovered our students, though motivated and smart, lacked job opportunities—so we started <a href="https://pioneeracademy.ai" class="text-[var(--accent-orange)] hover:text-[var(--accent-orange-dark)] font-semibold">Pioneer AI Academy</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body leading-relaxed">
            Now, Dallan uses GameNightGPT to teach our students how to be developers, and the students get paid to work on game manuals.
          </p>

        <!-- Thanks -->
        <div class="bg-dark-coffee rounded-xl p-8 text-center">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-accent-gold mb-4">Thanks for Being Here</h2>
          <p class="text-on-dark leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If GameNightGPT helps your game night run smoother—even once—that's a win.
          </p>
          <p class="text-on-dark leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If it also helps someone halfway around the world build a future in tech? That's real magic.
          </p>

            Now… what was that rules question again?
